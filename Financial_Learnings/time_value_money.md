# Time Value of Money (TVM)

## Definition
The **Time Value of Money (TVM)** is a financial concept that states that a sum of money is worth more now than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.  
This principle recognizes the impact of **interest**, **inflation**, and **opportunity cost** over time.

---

## Key Idea
Money available today can be invested to earn returns, meaning it can grow over time through **compounding interest**.

If someone offers you $100 today vs $100 a year from now. The $100 is worth more today, because you can put it to work and gain interest. Not only that but you will lose buying power in a year from now due to inflation.

## Core Formulas

### 1. Future Value (FV)

FV = PV * (1+ r)^n

- **PV** = Present Value  
- **r** = Interest rate per period  
- **n** = Number of periods  

---

### 2. Present Value (PV)
PV = PF / (1 + r)^n

Calculates the **current value** of a future amount, discounting it by the interest rate.

---

### 3. Future Value of an Annuity
\[
FV_{annuity} = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

---

### 4. Present Value of an Annuity
\[
PV_{annuity} = P \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

## Example
If you are to receive **$1,000** in **5 years** and the annual interest rate is **6%**,  
the present value (PV) is:

\[
PV = \frac{1000}{(1 + 0.06)^5} = 747.26
\]

So, **$1,000 in 5 years** is worth **$747.26 today** at a 6% discount rate.
