## Notes

- A bond can be held till maturity or it can be sold before then. The value of the bond may fluctuate depending on the interest rates. 


#### Bond Prices
- For a $1000 par value bond with a 10% coupon, we would get $100 per year in interest. Say the interest rates drop to 5%, now a new $1000 bond will only give $50 a year. This will make the 10% bond worth more, its price will increase until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment—in this case, the bond will trade at $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%. Likewise if the interest rate increased to 15%, now the bond will trade at $666.67.


#### Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) (percentage)

- YTM = [ C+ (FV - PV) ÷ t ] ÷ [ (FV + PV) ÷ 2 ]

  - C = Coupon Payment

  - FV = Face Value
  - PV = Present Value/Current Price
  - t = Years to Maturity

- The total anticipated return if the bond is held until maturity.

- if price > par: YTM < coupon rate, as part of the coupon is offset by capital loss at maturity.

- if price < par: YTM > coupon rate, as part of the return comes from price appreciation at maturity.

- if price == par: YTM = coupon rate, bond's market yield matches its coupon - fairly priced.

- When market rates go up, existing bonds with lower coupons are less attractive, so their prices drop until their YTM matches the new rates.
When market rates go down, existing bonds with higher coupons are more attractive, so their prices rise.

- coupon rate does not take into account the current value of the bond or actually return you'll earn if you buy the bond today.

- YTM takes into account the interest income and any capital gain / loss.
